# wia-availability-demo
Prototype that checks &amp; scores WIA data availability by country (HDX-first). Publishes a simple matrix via GitHub Pages.
A lightweight, HDX-first prototype that scans any ISO3 country for core WIA datasets (rainfall, IDPs, WASH PiN, MPI, population, cholera), scores their coverage, timeliness, and continuity, and publishes a simple availability matrix via GitHub Pages. Built for quick sharing with teams and designed to add dataset downloads and full WIA merges next.
